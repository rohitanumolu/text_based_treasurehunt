# Text-based treasure hunt game

A text-based game that I made in 2017 for my then girfriend (now wife) for her birthday. 

I developed a map of our university (where we did our Bachelors) and had in clues at different locations with respect to her special memories.
I then made an exe file for her to run instead of running the .py file using "pyinstaller". Pretty Straightforward. 

If anyone wants to do the same with .py files, it can be done by using the below code.

* Open the command prompt and type 

> cd "directory where your file is located"

I am assuming python is already installed and also pyinstaller. If not, you can install python [Here](https://www.python.org/) and library by typing the following in cmd
> pip install pyinstaller

> pyinstaller --onefile filename.py

This creates couple of folders in the directory. Open dist which is one of the folder, and open filename.exe to run the py script directly.
Share the home folder which has py script, the new folder etc. to anyone for them to play the game.

To try my game
----------------------------------------------------
The clues and map would make no sense for you, so I am providing you the directions to follow through the map.
> { (1 - s), (2 - w,d,w,d), (3 - a,w,w,a,a,a,a,a,a,w}, (4 - s,d,d,d,d,d,d,s,s,s,d), (5 - a,w,w,w,a,a,a,w), (6 - s,d,d,d,d), (7 - a,a,a,a,s,a),
 (8 - d,w,d,d,d,d,d,d,d), (9 - a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,a,s), (10 - w,d,d,d,d,s,a), (11 - d,w,d,d,d,d,d,w,d), (12 - a,s,a,a,a,s) }
 
Each ordered pair shows the clue number and directions to follow through for it. 

Passcode - lizzy

After its done, s and any key to quit.
